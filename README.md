# Woken - A Speculative reflections token to support the G$ ecosystem

Woken ($WOKE) is a modified ERC20 that takes a fee (10%) everytime users trade it. 
Half of these fees are automatically converted to G$ tokens using Voltage Finance liquidity pools. 
The other half is paid back to $WOKE holders automatically using SafeMoon's reflections logic, which incentivises hodling.
After G$'s have been bought they will immediately be burned for eternity, adding to the sustainability of the G$ ecosystem.
